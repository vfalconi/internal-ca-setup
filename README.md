# internal-ca-setup

Quick and dirty script to setup the folder structure for an OpenSSL Certificate Authority. Based heavily, if not entirely, on Jamie Nguyen's [OpenSSL Certificate Authority](https://jamielinux.com/docs/openssl-certificate-authority/index.html)

PLEASE, do not use this on servers that are open to the world.
